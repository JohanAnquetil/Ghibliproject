            <p style= "font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;">This project was realized with two friends of the "ADA Tech School" in the framework of collective projects during our second month of classes. 
                This website was my second project. We propose to the fans of the studio Ghibli to have a filmography and various information.
                The pedagogical objective was to familiarize ourselves with the APIs. We had chosen a free one, which unfortunately is now inaccessible. As a precaution, we had a copy that is stored in an object array in a JavaScript file.
                This site allowed me to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, to discover libraries like AnimateJS, to call an API, to make CSS and HTML interact with the JS file, to pass parameters in a URL in order to have only one HTML page for all the movies. Indeed, the site is very little written in "mock", the elements of the menu, the Timeline, the paragraphs and titles are directly from the API.
